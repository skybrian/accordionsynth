# An accordion synthesizer project

My goal is to eventually replicate the keyboard and sound of the bass side of an accordion in an electronic device that accordion players will find easy to adapt to. So far I've built three prototypes:

  * Prototype 1 was trying out a Teensy 4 with an audio shield on a breadboard, with 4 bass buttons.
  * For prototype 2, I put the buttons on two double-decker circuit boards (9 bass buttons).
   Here's the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6V9Kw87OYE). You can see the remains of prototype 1 in the background.
  * For prototype 3, I built a real case out of wood and laser-cut acrylic panels, to make a desktop device that's more easily portable. This one uses a Teensy 3.6. Here's the [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj9DO6gRxgs). I designed it in Onshape and you can [look at the CAD model online](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/49e3bde7fd0cf848110a849c/w/f0f076d4e6eda68337d8a8fa/e/61a0bfc531c55ddd0f7d8f48).
